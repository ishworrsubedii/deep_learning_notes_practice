# deep_learning

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the code and notes that will cover all aspect of the deep learning(i will try to cover as much
as possible). The code will be written in python and will be using the tensorflow library. The notes will be written in
markdown and will be using the jupyter notebook for the same.I will be sharing what i have learned and will be updating
the repository as i learn more.

## 2. Follow by the following order:

1. Introduction to deep learning and perceptron
   [Here](intro_perceptron)

2. Perceptron trick and training the perceptron
   [Here](perceptron_trick_and_train)

3. Perceptron loss function and hinge loss
   [Here](perceptron_loss_hinge_loss)

4. Multi Layer Perceptron
   [Here](multilayer_perceptron)

5. Artificial Neural Network
   [Here](artificial_neural_network)

6. Loss function and cost function in deep learning
   [Here](loss_function_deep_learning)

7. Convolutional Neural Network
   [Here](convolutional_neural_network)

## 3. How to run the code

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
   git clone
    ```
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
    ```angular2html
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the code using the following command:
    ```angular2html
    python file_name.py
    ```
   OR
    ```angular2html
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   and open the file in the jupyter notebook and run the code.

## 4. Contribution

Since this is my personal learning repository, i cannot accept any pull request. But if you have any suggestion or any
mistake then please raise an issue and i will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
